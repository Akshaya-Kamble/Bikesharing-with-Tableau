# Bikesharing-with-Tableau
# Bike sharing  data using Tableau

## Overview of the analysis: 
With the analysis of NYC bike sharing data and visualization we have to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. For this analyis we will create various visualizations on Tableau.Using Pandas we will convert the datatype of tripduration to datetime dataframe and convert the numeric values of gender to string values.These pre converted columns will speed up the visualizations rather than doing the conversions on Tableau and plotting the data.

### B. Below are the results of each visualization created in the Tableau story

#### 1. Checkout times for users:

This graph shows the length of time the bikes are checked out for all riders.The trip duration is shown in hours.
Looking at the graph we can conclude that the most number of bikes were rented for the five hour trip duration.

#### 2. Checkout times by gender:

This graph shows the length of time the bikes are checked out for all genders.The trip duration is shown in hours.
Looking at the graph we can conclude that the most number of bikes were rented by male riders for a selected trip duration than the female riders.

In this graph using heatmap we can conclude that more bikes are rented on a particular hour on a weekday. The dark colors are the hours with the highest number of bikes rented and the light colors show the least number of bikes rented.

#### 4. Trips by gender (weekday per hour):
![](https://github.com/Akshaya-Kamble/Bikesharing-with-Tableau/blob/main/Reference_Images/Trips%20by%20gender(weekday%20per%20hour).PNG)
In this graph we have the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap. Since the male riders have rented more bikes the heatmap shows a lot of darker shades.

#### 5. User trips by gender by weekday:
![](https://github.com/Akshaya-Kamble/Bikesharing-with-Tableau/blob/main/Reference_Images/user%20trips%20by%20gender%20by%20weekday.PNG)
This graph shows the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as a heatmap. Since the number of male riders are highest the heat map shows dark colors for this data.

#### 6. August peak hours:
![](https://github.com/Akshaya-Kamble/Bikesharing-with-Tableau/blob/main/Reference_Images/August%20peak%20hours.PNG)
Since summer is a good time to visit Ney York there are probably more number of bike riders exploring the city. The graph shows how many bikes are rented on hour of the day in the month of August.With 5pm having the highest number of riders.

This is a scatter plot which displays the starting location for the bike ride. The location with more bike rides is displayed in darker color and bigger radius.
